--------------------Description---------------------

Drawing program using JavaFX 8

How to run the program:
1. Open project in Netbeans

(or use the .jar)


-----------------Using the program------------------

In the help menu there is a "help" option that will give you the basic idea of how to use the program.


-----------------------Bugs-------------------------

Scribble doesn't work very well, it moves within the pane it is contained in.

The text modifying is a little buggy and not ideal, text area with transparent background may work better.


--------------------To Do list----------------------

Change text to a text area with transparent background, and

Fix scribble

Add stroke settings for lines and scribbles (width, smoothness, etc.)

Image editing. ie. filters

Implement undo/redo for modification of shapes (rather than just adding and deleting)

Multishape selection

Add project saving, rather than just image saving

Continuous pixel spray that doesn't require clicking

More user friendly color selection?
